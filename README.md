## Currency Converter with Java

- A currency converter (or currency exchange) is a mini project coded in Java programming language. This simple application provides a web-based interface for exchanging/converting money from one currency (say $) to another currency (say €).

- The complete source code of the currency exchange application can be downloaded from the link below. This is just a mini-project, so the project report and documentation are unavailable. You can go through the description below for the project abstract.

- Currency Converter Project Abstract:
Different countries use different currencies, and there is daily variation in these currencies relative to one another. Those who transfer money from one country to another (one currency to another) must be updated with the latest currency exchange rates in the market.

- The currency converter mini project is built keeping this thing in mind. It is simply a calculator-like app developed using Ajax, Java servlets web features. In this application, there are regular updates about the currency of every country which displays the present currency market value and conversion rate.

- Any user can use such an application, but it is mainly useful for business, shares, and finance-related areas where money transfer and currency exchange takes place on a daily basis.

- In this currency converter app, users are provided with an option to select the type of conversion, i.e. from “this” currency to “that” currency. This simple feature allows users to enter the amount to be converted (say currency in Dollars), and display the converted amount (say currency in euros).
